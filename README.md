## Justification of template engine

Handlebars extends Mustache by including additional functionality, including helper functions, block helpers, and built-in helpers such as "if", "each", and "with". While Mustache maintains a minimalistic approach, I plan on using these features for displaying user goals. For example, I can use the "each" helper to iterate through a list of goals and display them on the page. I can also use the "if" helper to display a message if the user has no goals. I can also use the "with" helper to display a message if the user has no goals in a specific category.
